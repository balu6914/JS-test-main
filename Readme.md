ðŸ“Œ **Issue:**

2. **Ensured `description` was correctly included** in form submission.  
3. **Validated Redux state management** in `frontend/src/domains/notice/reducer/notice-reducer.ts`  
4. **Updated API call** to include `description` in the request payload.  
5. **Tested & verified that `description` is saved correctly** after submitting the form.

3. **Fixed issues in request handling and database interactions.**  
4. **Tested all CRUD functions** to confirm they work as expected.
